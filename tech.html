            <h2>Apple faces UK ‘iCloud monopoly’ compensation claim worth $3.8B</h2>
            <p>U.K. consumer rights group ‘Which?’ is filing a legal claim against Apple under competition law on behalf of some 40 million users of iCloud, its cloud storage service.

                The collective proceeding lawsuit, which is seeking £3 billion in compensation damages (around $3.8 billion at current exchange rates), alleges that Apple has broken competition rules by giving its own cloud storage service preferential treatment and effectively locking people into paying for iCloud at “rip-off” prices.

        <h2>Mechanical Batteries: The Future of Energy Storage?</h2>
        <p>
            Immense efforts are being made to develop efficient energy-storage devices to cater to the constantly increasing energy demand due to population growth. Research is being carried out to explore the various aspects of batteries to increase their energy density, charge storage, and stability. This book discusses in detail the important components of battery development, such as electrodes, electrolytes, active materials, and battery construction. It starts with the advantages and limitations of the hallmark lithium-ion batteries, evolving to the introduction of other metal-based batteries such as zinc-, sodium-, metal–air-, and magnesium-based batteries. It specifically reviews lithium–sulfur batteries, which can produce high energy densities.
